Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto,
blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp)
to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative
programming.

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a
way that mirrors life.
